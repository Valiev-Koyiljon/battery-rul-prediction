# Battery Remaining Useful Life Prediction

Predict the Remaining Useful Life (RUL) of batteries based on features derived from voltage and current behavior.

The dataset, obtained from the Hawaii Natural Energy Institute, includes information on 14 NMC-LCO 18650 batteries. These batteries, with a nominal capacity of 2.8 Ah, were cycled over 1000 times at 25Â°C with a CC-CV charge rate of C/2 and a discharge rate of 1.5C.

### Dataset Information
